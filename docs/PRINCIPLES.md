# Learning Principles - Justin Skycak Framework

*Extracted from Q&A #4: How I Approach Learning in Other Domains*

## Core Learning Principles

### **Fundamental Approach**
- **Active vs. Passive Learning**: Most time should be spent doing exercises, not consuming information
- **Information consumption should only serve to enable production/practice**
- **Avoid "spectator mentality"** - watching videos or reading without practice

### **Bite-sized Learning Cycles**
- **Break content into small, digestible chunks**
- **Follow each piece of information immediately with 2-3 exercises**
- **Keep feedback loops tight and frequent**

### **Breadth-First Approach**
- **Build foundational layer completely before adding complexity**
- **Like laying bricks: complete each layer before building upward**
- **Avoid going deep on one topic while missing foundational elements**

### **Memory Anchoring**
- **In wide/flat knowledge domains, establish "memory anchors" throughout the space**
- **Use spaced repetition on key primitives before connecting them**
- **Build chunks, then chunks of chunks, then chunks of chunks of chunks**

## Practical Implementation

### **For Hierarchical Domains (like Biology/Chinese Characters)**
- Use spaced repetition with explicit performance tracking
- Demand immediate practice after information exposure
- Avoid open-ended exploration that breaks systematic progression
- Track performance and adjust difficulty to stay at edge of ability
- Start with **Semantic Sessions** for guided anchors, then switch to **Practice Modes** for targeted drills

### **For Wide/Flat Domains (like Music/Language)**
- Establish memory anchors across the entire knowledge space first
- Use scaffolded practice (easier → harder versions)
- Track mistakes quantitatively and focus on error-prone areas
- Balance difficulty to stay at edge of abilities

## Universal Tactics

- **Aim for high exercise density per session** (20+ exercises per 30 minutes)
- **Track mistakes/performance quantitatively**
- **Adjust difficulty to maintain cognitive challenge**
- **Use spaced repetition based on performance data**

## Key Success Factors

- **Expert learning system design required**
- **Must detect when system drifts off-course**
- **Requires systematic approach over motivation-based learning**
- **Clear, measurable performance goals**

## Application to HSK Flashcards

These principles are fully implemented in the HSK Flashcards app:

- ✅ **High exercise density**: 20+ questions per 30 minutes
- ✅ **Bite-sized cycles**: Individual character practice with immediate feedback
- ✅ **Memory anchoring**: Spaced repetition system with performance tracking
- ✅ **Breadth-first**: Progressive unlocks ensure foundational mastery
- ✅ **Active learning**: Minimal passive consumption, maximum active practice
- ✅ **Quantitative tracking**: Response times, accuracy rates, difficulty assessment
- ✅ **Adaptive difficulty**: Progressive unlock gates maintain optimal challenge

## Key Quotes

> "Most of the time that you spend in your learning session should be doing exercises. You need to consume information to know what exercises to do and how to do them. But if you're trying to maximize efficiency, get the most bang for your buck, every piece of information that you consume should be consumed with the purpose of enabling you to produce."

> "Build chunks in long-term memory. Build chunks on top of chunks. Chunks of chunks of chunks all the way until you're wielding these gigantic swaths of memory and information. Almost effortlessly. Things just pop into your head whenever they're needed."
