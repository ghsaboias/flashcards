├── Focus Mode: [Challenge Mode | Review Mode]
├── Content Selection: [Single Set | Multi-Set]
│   ├── Single Set → Dropdown selection from HSK sets
│   └── Multi-Set → Checkbox selection of multiple sets
└── Actions:
    ├── 🚀 Start Practice → `beginAutoSession()` → API `/api/sessions/auto-start`
    └── Advanced Options → Switch to Traditional Mode
```

### **Secondary Entry**: Traditional Mode
```

    ├── Pinyin generation (client-side via pinyin-pro)
    └── Audio TTS (browser Web Speech API)
```

## **🚀 Key User Journey Patterns**

### **Efficiency-Focused Learning Path** (Primary)
```
Entry → High-Intensity Mode → Auto-Start → Adaptive Practice → Knowledge Gap Analysis → Reinforcement Loop
```

### **Comprehensive Learning Path** (Advanced Users)
```
Entry → Traditional Mode → Mode Selection → Content Customization → Practice → Analytics Review → Targeted Practice
```

### **Review & Maintenance Path**
```
Entry → Browse Mode → Content Review → Practice Incorrect → SRS Review → Performance Analytics
```

## **📱 User Experience Considerations**

### **Accessibility Features**
- Auto-focus on input fields
- ARIA labels and roles
- Keyboard navigation support
- Audio support for Chinese characters
- Progress indicators with screen reader support

### **Performance Optimizations**
- Lazy loading of pinyin library
- Code splitting for different modes
- Response time tracking for analytics
- Minimal UI in high-intensity mode
- Auto-TTS with Chinese character detection

### **Progressive Enhancement**
- Fallback to local review mode if server unavailable
- Client-side pinyin generation
- Browser-based audio synthesis
- Graceful degradation of advanced features
