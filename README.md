## Efficient Learning Features

### **Multi-Domain Learning System**
- **Domain Selection**: Choose between Chinese (HSK), World Geography, and more
- **Content Filtering**: Sessions respect domain selection for targeted practice
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easy addition of new knowledge domains
- **Independent Progress**: Each domain tracks progress separately

### **Home Hub Overview**
- **Semantic Sessions**: One-click connection-aware practice plus knowledge graph shortcut
- **Cluster Picker**: Manual cluster control with progress and phase-aware start buttons
- **Practice Modes**: Multi-set drills, difficulty filters, SRS, browse, drawing, and stats access
- **Navigation**: Consistent `Home`, `Semantic`, `Practice`, `Stats` entries across desktop and mobile

### **Adaptive Learning System**
- **Progressive unlocks**: Master fundamentals before advancing (70-85% accuracy gates)
- **Smart feedback timing**: Duration adapts to question difficulty and response speed
- **Knowledge gap focus**: Completion emphasizes struggling concepts over statistics

### **Systematic Progression**
- **Breadth-first learning**: Complete foundational layers before complexity
- **Memory anchoring**: Immediate re-testing of incorrect answers
- **Unified SRS table**: View review schedules, accuracy stats, and difficulty in one interface

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: Vite + React TypeScript app with hooks/contexts pattern (`frontend/`)
  - Modular structure: `hooks/`, `contexts/`, `types/`, `utils/`, `components/`
  - Session manager composed from `useSessionStateStore`, `useSessionLifecycle`, `useSessionData`, `useConnectionAwareSession`
  - Type-safe API client with comprehensive TypeScript definitions
- **Backend**: Cloudflare Worker with Hono framework + Durable Objects (`backend/`)
  - Extracted utilities: database queries, statistics, difficulty assessment
  - Updated dependencies: Hono 4.9.8, TypeScript 5.9.2, Wrangler 4.38.0
- **Database**: Cloudflare D1 (SQLite) with progressive unlock logic
- **Data**: Multi-domain content (HSK Level 1: 150+ characters, Geography: countries/capitals)

## Learning Principles

This app implements **efficient learning principles** for systematic knowledge acquisition:

### **Active vs. Passive Learning**
- Maximizes exercise time over information consumption
- Immediate practice follows each information exposure
- Eliminates "spectator mentality" of passive review

### **Bite-sized Learning Cycles**
- Small, digestible content chunks with tight feedback loops
- 2-6 second adaptive feedback based on difficulty and response time
- Prevents cognitive overload while maintaining challenge

### **Memory Anchoring Strategy**
- Establishes foundational "anchors" before building complexity
- Spaced repetition on key primitives with performance tracking
- Progressive unlock system ensures systematic knowledge building

## Quick Start
