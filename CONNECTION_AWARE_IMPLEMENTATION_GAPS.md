## üö® Critical Impact Assessment

### User Experience Reality
1. **Current**: Users experience random character drilling that destroys semantic relationships
2. **Expected**: Users would experience connected learning that builds semantic knowledge
3. **Gap**: Complete disconnection between implemented system and user experience

### Learning Science Effectiveness
1. **Research Goal**: Solve plateau through semantic relationship preservation
2. **Implementation**: Sophisticated system that respects character connections
3. **Reality**: System inaccessible, plateau problem unsolved

### Development ROI
1. **Investment**: Significant development time on infrastructure
2. **Return**: 0% user benefit due to integration gaps
3. **Risk**: System decay without user validation and feedback
