# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
`frontend/` holds the Vite + React TypeScript client, restructured with:
- `src/components/` - React components with updated imports
- `src/hooks/` - Custom hooks including `useSessionManager.ts` (474 lines) and `useSessionContext.ts`
- `src/contexts/` - React Context providers like `SessionContext.tsx`
- `src/types/` - TypeScript definitions (`api-types.ts`, `component-props.ts`, `session-types.ts`)
- `src/utils/` - Utility functions including `api-client.ts` (replaces `api.ts`), `session-utils.ts`, `stats-aggregation.ts`, and more
- `dist/` - Generated bundles (never edit by hand)

`backend/` hosts the Cloudflare Worker with refactored utilities:
- `src/worker.ts` and `src/sessions-do.ts` - Main entrypoints (refactored)
- `src/utils/` - Extracted utilities: `db-queries.ts` (271 lines), `stats-utils.ts` (77 lines), `difficulty-utils.ts` (22 lines)
- `src/srs.ts` and `src/types.ts` - Shared SRS helpers and types
- Schema files: `schema.sql`, `seed-hsk1.sql`

Shared vocabulary data lives at `hsk30-expanded.csv`; keep large datasets derived from it out of version control unless curated.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
Use Bun in each workspace: `cd frontend && bun install` and `cd backend && bun install` to sync dependencies.

**Backend dependencies updated (latest refactor):**
- Hono 4.9.8 (from earlier version)
- TypeScript 5.9.2 (improved type checking)
- Wrangler 4.38.0 (latest Cloudflare tooling)
- Removed WebWorker lib from tsconfig (not needed)

During UI work run `bunx vite` inside `frontend/` for the dev server, and finish by `bunx tsc -b && bunx vite build` before pushing. For the Worker, `bunx wrangler dev` starts a local tunnel, `bunx wrangler deploy` publishes to Cloudflare, and `bunx wrangler d1 migrations apply flashcards` keeps the D1 instance in sync. Apply schema or seed data with `bunx wrangler d1 execute flashcards --file ./schema.sql` or `--file ./seed-hsk1.sql`.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Favor strict, typed APIs: keep TypeScript's `strict` mode green, prefer explicit return types for exported functions. Type definitions are organized in:
- `backend/src/types.ts` - Backend shared types
- `frontend/src/types/` - Frontend types (`api-types.ts`, `component-props.ts`, `session-types.ts`)

Follow the project's two-space indentation, single quotes, and descriptive naming:
- PascalCase component names (`HighIntensityMode.tsx`)
- Descriptive hook names (`useSessionManager.ts`, `useSessionContext.ts`)
- Organized utility modules (`api-client.ts`, `session-utils.ts`, `stats-aggregation.ts`)

Run `bunx eslint .` in the frontend before submitting, and mirror that style in Worker code. With the new modular structure, maintain clear separation of concerns between hooks, contexts, utilities, and components.

## Testing Guidelines
Automated tests are not yet wired up; flag that gap during reviews. When adding coverage, colocate Vitest suites alongside modules (`frontend/src/components/__tests__/Component.test.tsx`) and exercise core session flows plus D1 access functions. Until the suite exists, smoke-test the SPA via the Vite dev server and validate Worker endpoints with `curl` against `wrangler dev`. Do not ship regressions without manual verification notes.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
History follows Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`). Write present-tense summaries under 72 characters and group related changes per commit. PRs must include: scope overview, testing notes (commands run, manual checks), linked issue or task, and screenshots/GIFs for UI changes. Keep branches up to date with main before requesting review.

## Security & Configuration Tips
Secrets and environment bindings stay out of Git; configure them via `wrangler.toml` and Cloudflare dashboard variables. Migrations are source-controlledâ€”never edit production tables manually. When working with CSV imports, script transformations instead of committing ad-hoc spreadsheet exports.
